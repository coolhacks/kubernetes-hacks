It handles scheduling onto nodes in a compute cluster and actively manages workloads to ensure that their state matches the users declared intentions. Using the concepts of \"labels\" and \"pods\", it groups the containers which make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.\r\n\r\nReference: [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/)\r\n\r\n# Why Kubernetes ?\r\n\r\nKubernetes is one of the popular open source projects that has been developing and evolving on the infrastructure platform.\r\nWIP(Work in Progress)....\r\n\r\n# Contents:\r\n\r\n* [Dockerfiles](https://github.com/coolhacks/kubernetes-hacks/tree/master/dockerfiles)\r\n* [Docs](https://github.com/coolhacks/kubernetes-hacks/tree/master/docs)\r\n* [Examples](https://github.com/coolhacks/kubernetes-hacks/tree/master/examples)\r\n\r\n# Contributing: \r\n\r\nThis is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:\r\n\r\n- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work (usually master).\r\n- Make commits of logical units.\r\n- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.\r\n- Make sure the tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate.\r\n- Submit a pull request to the original repository.\r\n\r\nThanks for your contributions!\r\n\r\nCheck out [Contributing](https://github.com/coolhacks/kubernetes-hacks/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) section for more details.\r\n\r\n# License:\r\n\r\nThe content of this repo is released under the MIT License by [Ramit Surana](http://ramitsurana.github.io).\r\nYou can find a copy of this license in [LICENSE](https://github.com/coolhacks/kubernetes-hacks/blob/master/LICENSE) or at http://opensource.org/licenses/mit.\r\n\r\n",
